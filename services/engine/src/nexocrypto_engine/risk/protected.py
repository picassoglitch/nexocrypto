"""Breakeven manager + ratcheting protected-profit stop (ARCHITECTURE §6).

The spec example: "up $100, continue → protect at least $70" — made precise here as a
**net** floor on PnL after the exit taker fee + accrued funding. The floor only ratchets
UP, never down.

Invariants enforced by tests:
  * On every new peak, floor moves up.
  * On a pullback, floor does NOT move down.
  * The amount protected is what actually lands in the account (net of exit fee + funding).
  * Floor never reaches the peak (giveback in (0, 1]).
