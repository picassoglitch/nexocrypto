"""ExecutionEngine — turns an APPROVED TradeDecision into a venue order.

This is the only module that places an order on an exchange. It sits at the very end of
the hot path:

    snapshot → strategy.evaluate → RiskEngine.authorize_new_entry (binding) → ExecutionEngine

CLAUDE.md compliance (these are not optional):
  * No LLM anywhere in this path (rule 2).
  * The Risk Engine has already run and is the final authority (rule 3). The executor
    only carries out an `approved=True` decision; anything else is refused here too.
  * `full_auto` is refused in the MVP, and only `semi_auto` may open a live entry
    (rule 5). `paper`/`backtest` must never reach a venue — they have their own fill
    simulators.
  * Every exchange write goes through the idempotency store (rule 8). A key that is
    already claimed is dropped as a duplicate, never double-sent.
  * Any connector failure fails SAFE: we return a `failed` report and never raise into
    the caller — the order is treated as not-placed (rule 3: fail safe, not open).
  * The caller persists the returned report to orders/trades/audit_logs (rule 9).
