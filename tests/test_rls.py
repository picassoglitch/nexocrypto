"""Phase 1 acceptance: RLS keeps users from reading each other's rows.

Strategy:
  * Provision two auth.users (alice, bob), insert matching nexocrypto.users rows
    via the superuser session (RLS is bypassed for superusers — that's correct;
    user provisioning runs as service_role in prod).
  * For each per-user table, insert a row owned by alice + a row owned by bob
    using a service_role session (RLS still applies, but our policies don't gate
    inserts against service_role; the with-check policy enforces user_id match).
    Concretely: we open a session and SET LOCAL request.jwt.claim.sub = alice,
    SET ROLE to a non-superuser so RLS actually applies, then insert.
  * Reopen as alice (non-superuser, JWT.sub = alice) and read every table — must
    see exactly her row.
  * Re-bind to bob's JWT sub on the same connection — must see exactly his row.
  * Assert cross-user reads return zero rows.
